# Pygame Games
Repository of my games made in pygame.

## How To Download?
1. First of all you need to install python I used python 3.6+ and pygame 1.9.2+ for programming.
2. Download the folder of the game you want and run the main.py file.
3. If you get a "missing error", make sure all the files are in the same folder as you downloaded the game.
